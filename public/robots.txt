# Prevent crawlers loading tons of /train/* pages and having the server reload 
# GTFS-R data each time. No reason for them to look in /admin/* either.
#
# Unfortunately even though the /train/* pages have noindex set, they still get
# crawled all the time because the stop pages that lead to them do NOT have
# nofollow set. Setting nofollow on stop pages wouldn't fix the problem entirely
# either, because in theory the home page can link to /train/* pages too.
